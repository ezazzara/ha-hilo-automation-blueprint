  name: Hilo Challenge Control – AM/PM Temperature Strategy
  description: >
    Manage Hilo challenge phases dynamically with separate AM and PM temperature strategies,
    skip toggles, preheat, comfort recovery, and scene restoration.

    Phases:
      1️⃣ Preheat → triggered by Preheat sensor (unless skipped)
      2️⃣ Challenge → triggered by Peak in Progress (unless skipped)
      3️⃣ Comfort Recovery → automatically calculated from normal temperature + offset
      4️⃣ Restore Scene → restores user-defined scene after recovery
      Note: By default both AM and PM challenges are enabled.
